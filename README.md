### 🧠 The Analytics Advantage
Most analysts see rows of data. **I see patterns of behavior.** My clinical background provides a unique lens for:
1.  **Diagnostic Analytics:** Understanding *why* customers are leaving or buying.
2.  **Predictive Insights:** Spotting behavioral shifts before they impact the bottom line.
3.  **Strategic Communication:** Translating complex data into clear, actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
